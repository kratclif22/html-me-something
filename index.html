                <ul>
                    <li>Rounds</li>
                        <p>Each Event consists of two to three preliminary
                            rounds of six to eight competitors in each event and
                            one to two judges (depending on tournament size). Each
                            competitor presents their piece for the judges. The judges
                            then rank each competitor in that round based on the number
                            of total competitors.
                        </p>
                    <li>Scoring</li>
                        <p>Forensics (or Speech) is like golf: the lower the score the better. 
                            Scores for each round per each Event are tabulated and after all the 
                            preliminary rounds are complete, each competitor is given a final score
                            to determine if they qualify for the Final round in each Event.
                        </p>
                    <li>Finals</li>
                        <p>The six to eight competitors (depending on ties in preliminary scoring) 
                            perform a final round for three judges and their peers. The judges then rank
                            these Finalists and rankings are announced at the Award Ceremony.
                        </p>
                    <li>Awards</li>
                        <p>A ceremonious event at the end of the tournament after all final rounds
                            are completed and tabulated. The finalists from each Event are presented an 
                            award based on final rank starting from sixth place leading up to first place.

                <ul>
                    <li>Interpretation Events</li>
                        <p>Interp Events are 8 minutes in length and can be cut from any published source.
                            Most often plays and books are used, but movies or poems can be used as well. The 
                            content should be concise and easy for the audience to follow. These are sometimes
                            referred to as "acting" events.
                        </p>
                    <li>Impromptu Events</li>
                        <p>Impromptu Events are just as they sound: on-the-spot speeches prepared during the round
                            or, in the case of Extemporaneous Speaking, in a 45 minute window before each round. The
                            competitors are given a topic based on the event. Extemp focuses on current
                            world affairs; Impromptu topics can be almost anything from Mango to Mother Theresa
                            to Identity Politics; Radio Speaking is a mock radio broadcast formulated with 
                            the basics of a radio show: news, weather, sports, adverts.
                        </p>
                    <li>Traditional Oratory</li>
                        <p>These events are what most people think of when you say "I am giving a speech". These 
                            events are 8 minutes in lenght and cover a range of styles and frameworks. Original
                            Oratory is a persuasive speech on any topic; Declaration Speaking is a paraphrased speech
                            from a past source such as Obama's 2008 inagural address; Special Occasion Speaking
                            is a comical speech that focuses on persuasion.

            <h2 class="section-title">Judging</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Critique</li>
                        <p>The judges in each round rank AND critique each competitor. The critique should be helpful
                            to the competitor. Often, judges are asked to continue to judge tournaments throughout the year
                            and are paid by the school from which they are hired. If the judge consistently gives
                            negative and demoralizing feedback to the competitors, the judge likely not be
                            asked to return. A good judge is impartial and objective driven.
                        </p>
                    <li>Ranking</li>
                        <p>Rankings are given in each round and determine the total score of each competitor. Rankings can 
                            sometimes greatly differ from judge to judge. A competitor might be ranked 1,1,6 - this
                            phenomenon is called "squirreling". Judges who consistently "squirrel" competitors are 
                            considered unfit and will not be asked to return.
                        </p>
                    <li>Aptitude</li>
                        <p>Judges should have a good understanding of the events they are judging. Judges often judge the
                            same events from tournament to tournament, but never the same event in each tournament. 
                            Judges should be objective focused and want each competitor to succeed and learn from their experience.

                <ul>
                    <li>Experience</li>
                        <p>Coaching gives the competitors a chance to present their piece to their coaches and to their peers. Coaching
                            is a way for competitors to practice in front of a live audience and receive good, honest feedback to allow
                            their piece and performance to grow.
                        </p>
                    <li>Repetition</li>
                        <p>Repetition is a necessary tool used by competitors to help them memorize their piece. Almost all of the Events
                            require that the competitor be memorized and perform without stumbles or memory lapses.
                        </p>
                    <li>Empathy</li>
                        <p>Coaching can be exhausting because at times, competitors get stuck in the same routine of 
                            delivery. Coaching MUST be a compassionate experince for both the competitor and the coach in order
                            to avoid burn out.

                <ul>
                    <li>#1 Fear</li>
                        <p>Public speaking is often listed as the #1 Fear of Americans today. Speech gives students a
                            chance to overcome this fear before their college and professional lives begin.
                        </p>
                    <li>Relationships</li>
                        <p>The relationships developed during the Speech writing and speech giving process are invaluable and 
                            contribute greatly to the growth of students before they leave High School. 
                        </p>
                    <li>Practice Practice Practice</li>
                        <p>Speech gives students the opportunity to learn the value of practice. Practice makes perfect
                            and helps students understand the cycle of speech writing and giving.
                        </p>
                    <li>Memory</li>
                        <p>Anecdotally, my memory is actually really good! I attribute my ablilty to remember names
                            and faces with my years devoted to Speech.
                        </p>
                    <li>Professional Applications</li>
                        <p>Speech is a great way to get students started on their professional skills before they are even in 
                            the professional job market. Presenting confidently, being prepared for tasks in advance,
                            memorizing information, talking to and sharing information with unfamiliar people, knowing how to
                            communicate verbally in a way that is clear and concise, the list of Professional
                            Applications can go on and on!
